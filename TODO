Tasks

[ ] Make processed branch selectable.  Currently it assumes master.

[C] Return user to the commit and branch SPM was started with; not jump
    user to master.  This is important because we are using `git stash
    pop`!  Popping at the wrong commit is bad.

[ ] Inhibit program if git status --porcelain has lines.  This is safer
    than stashing.  Remove stashing code.
