Tasks

[ ] Make processed branch selectable.  Currently it assumes master.

[ ] Inhibit program if git status --porcelain has lines.  This is safer
    than stashing.  Remove stashing code.

[ ] Output commit hash so that a user can specify a commit from which to
    resume.

[ ] Support resuming from some commit hash.

[ ] If the same file is specified more than once, SPM should still only
    count that file once.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

[X] Ensure that the value of total is non-decreasing.  This is the way
    we handle branching and merging of the git tree.

[C] Return user to the commit and branch SPM was started with; not jump
    user to master.  This is important because we are using `git stash
    pop`!  Popping at the wrong commit is bad.
