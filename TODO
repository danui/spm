Tasks


----------------------------------------------------------------------

[ ] Use Eclipse JGit instead of `exec()` calls to `git`.  URL below.

        http://eclipse.org/jgit/download/

[ ] Update regular expression to ignore lines where non-whitespace
    characters appear before the item brackets.  So code like the
    following does not get counted as an item.  (Even though it is
    atypical for 'X' to be used for such purposes.)

        for (X=0; X < N; ++X)
                A[X] = 0;

[ ] Make processed branch selectable.  Currently it assumes master.

[ ] Inhibit program if git status --porcelain has lines.  This is safer
    than stashing.  Remove stashing code.

[X] Output commit hash so that a user can specify a commit from which to
    resume.

[ ] Support resuming from some commit hash.

[ ] If the same file is specified more than once, SPM should still only
    count that file once.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

[X] Ensure that the value of total is non-decreasing.  This is the way
    we handle branching and merging of the git tree.

[C] Return user to the commit and branch SPM was started with; not jump
    user to master.  This is important because we are using `git stash
    pop`!  Popping at the wrong commit is bad.
